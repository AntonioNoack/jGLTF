# jGLTF

A modified GLTF library for Java, original: https://github.com/javagl/JglTF

I made a few functions public, which were private before, and rewrote the PBR shaders. I made these changes, so the library is compatible with my video editor [Rem's Studio](https://remsstudio.phychi.com/).

This also includes the Logger, which has been changed to a custom implementation, which my editor can hook into.
